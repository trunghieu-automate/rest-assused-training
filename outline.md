# Outline
a 7-day training on RestAssured API testing framework could be:

- Day 1: Introduction to RESTful web services and RestAssured framework. Learn how to set up RestAssured in Maven project, write basic GET and POST requests, and validate response status code, headers and body.
- Day 2: Learn how to use different types of parameters (query, path, form, header) in RestAssured requests. Learn how to extract data from response using JsonPath and XmlPath. Learn how to use Hamcrest matchers for assertions.
- Day 3: Learn how to use RestAssured DSL (given-when-then) to write more readable and structured tests. Learn how to use filters, logging, cookies and authentication in RestAssured requests. Learn how to handle different content types (JSON, XML, HTML) in RestAssured responses.
- Day 4: Learn how to use RestAssured specifications (request and response) to reuse common configurations and avoid code duplication. Learn how to use RestAssured mocks (MockMvc) to test Spring MVC controllers without deploying the application.
- Day 5: Learn how to use RestAssured for CRUD (create-read-update-delete) operations on RESTful web services. Learn how to design test cases using CRUD pattern and modularize the data layer, API calls and test codes2.
- Day 6: Learn how to use RestAssured for schema validation of JSON and XML responses. Learn how to use JsonSchemaValidator and XmlSchemaValidator classes to validate against JSON Schema and XML Schema1.
- Day 7: Learn how to integrate RestAssured with testing frameworks such as TestNG and JUnit. Learn how to use annotations, assertions, listeners, reports and parallel execution features of these frameworks with RestAssured tests.
